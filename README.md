## Welcome!

*Alley Cat* is a simple 2D platformer game written in MIPS assembly language, where you navigate a cat through various obstacles in an alley.

## Running the files

1. To run the game, download MIPS

2. Then, load the assembled file into the MIPS emulator.

3. Open the bitmap with a 512x512 display, and open the keyboard input tool.

4. Click Run in MIPS.

5. Once the game starts, use the arrow keys to move the cat and avoid obstacles to progress through the alley.

### Built with
*Alley Cat* is built in MIPS assembly.

### Continued development

After completing this project, I look forward to enhancing *Alley Cat* with more levels, new obstacles, and possibly introducing power-ups!
